    "# Cyber Developer Day 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools in cybersecurity in part due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of cyber threat detection and response by accelerating analyst workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Determining the impact of a documented Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) on a specific project or container is a labor-intensive and manual task. This process involves the collection, comprehension, and synthesis of various pieces of information to ascertain whether immediate remediation, such as patching, is necessary upon the identification of a new CVE. Often, reasons cited for not updating a library affected by a CVE include the occurrence of scan false positives, the existence of mitigating factors, or the absence of necessary environments or dependencies for the exploit to be viable. Once an analyst has determined the library is not affected, a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document must be created to standardize and distribute the results. The efficiency of this process can be significantly enhanced through the deployment of an event-driven LLM agent pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals:\n",
    "Our team developed a cybersecurity vulnerability analysis tool to aid in assessing the exploitability of CVEs in specific projects and containers. The following tutorial shows step-by-step how to leverage LLMs, RAG, and agents to create toy version and microservice running LLM-powered CVE exploitability analysis.\n",
    "Students can experiment with the different modules to expand on this use case or leverage these modular pieces to construct a new pipeline of their own.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have the task generation for this workflow ready, how can we automate getting the answers for our checklist items?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. In Part 1c above, we added additional CVE details into the prompt by hand. While this strategy can be effective for adding additional context for very specific items like CVE Details, it requires apriori knowledge of what details to include (like those from NVD). When you would like to help your LLM with its query by adding more context in real-time, you're ready for RAG (Retreival Augmented Generation). \n",
    "\n",
    "When a query or checklist item is posed to an LLM equipped with RAG, the model first consults the vector database to find relevant information related to the query. This retrieved data is then combined with the original question and fed back into the LLM. With this enriched context, the LLM can generate a more accurate and informed response, potentially including evidence or reasoning based on the newly incorporated data. This approach not only improves the quality of the LLM's outputs and for our tool gives it access to project and container specific information to determine CVE exploitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having a query and LLM, RAG requires additional information to be stored in a vector database. One mechanism of finding the proper information from the database is to first embed the query into the same vector space and retreive the top most similiar items via a distance metric. The additional information is then presented in the prompt of the LLM. The neighboring vectors in the database are said to be \"semanically similiar\" to the query and likely relevant.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To trigger the microservice, we will use a CURL request to send a request to the microservice. Since the notebook cannot run commands while the microservice is running, we need to open up a new terminal to send the request. To do that, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Jupyter Lab, press Ctrl + Shift + L (Shift + ⌘ + L on Mac) to open a new Launcher tab\n",
    "2. In the Launcher tab, click on the Terminal icon to open a new terminal\n",
    "3. In the terminal, run the following command to send a request to the microservice:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl --request POST \\\n",
    "  --url http://localhost:26302/scan \\\n",
    "  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n",
    "  --data '[{\n",
    "      \"cve_info\" : \"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvbdev.c has a use-after-free, related to dvb_register_device dynamically allocating fops.\"\n",
    "   }]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Once the request is sent, the microservice will process the request and return the results in the terminal\n",
    "   1. To see the results, switch back to the Notebook tab. You should see that the microservice received your request and started processing it.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   I20240308 16:00:56.422039 3010283 http_server.cpp:129] Received request: POST : /scan\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   2. It helps to have the terminal and the notebook side by side so you can see the results in the terminal as they come in. To do this, click on the terminal tab and drag it to the right side of the screen. You should then be able to see the terminal and the notebook side by side similar to the image below:\n",
