    "# Cyber Developer Day 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are becoming essential tools in **cybersecurity** in part due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of cyber threat detection and response by **accelerating analyst workflows**. However, prototyping and moving these accelerated workflows into production can be daunting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybersecurity remains among the top three challenges impacting every industry—from the public sector to financial services, telecommunications, retail, automotive, and more. Most CEOs believe organizations with the most **advanced generative AI capabilities** will have a competitive advantage and are looking for ways to incorporate this into their business. While adversaries are already leveraging generative AI in their attacks, there is significant potential to harness this power for **cyber defense**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial will focus on **accelerating an exploitability analysis workflow** to increase analyst productivity and enhance cybersecurity defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the impact of a documented **CVE** on a specific project or container is a labor-intensive and manual task. This intricate process involves the collection, comprehension, and synthesis of various pieces of information to ascertain whether immediate remediation, such as patching, is necessary upon the identification of a new CVE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Collection:** The process involves significant manual labor to collect and synthesize relevant information.\n",
    "- **Decision Complexity:** Decisions on whether to update a library impacted by a CVE often hinge on various considerations, including:\n",
    "  - **Scan False Positives:** Occasionally, vulnerability scans may incorrectly flag a library as vulnerable, leading to a false alarm.\n",
    "  - **Mitigating Factors:** In some cases, existing safeguards within the environment may reduce or negate the risk posed by a CVE.\n",
    "  - **Lack of Required Environments or Dependencies:** For an exploit to succeed, specific conditions must be met. The absence of these necessary elements can render a vulnerability irrelevant.\n",
    "- **Manual Documentation:** Once an analyst has determined the library is not affected, a **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)** document must be created to standardize and distribute the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of this process can be significantly enhanced through the deployment of an **event-driven LLM agent pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team developed a **cybersecurity vulnerability analysis tool** to aid in assessing the exploitability of CVEs in specific projects and containers. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of using **LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agents** to create both a toy version and a microservice running **LLM-powered CVE exploitability analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have the chance to experiment with various modules, boosting your skills and understanding of these technologies. This experience will prepare you to later expand your use case by exploring new functionalities, enhancing the current setup, or even creating your own tailored solutions to meet specific needs or address new challenges.\n",

    "In this lab, we will be using [NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/) as our generative AI platform. NeMo is a cloud-native framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models with a familiar ChatGPT-like interface. Utilizing NeMo (or any other generative AI service) in our pipelines allows us to offload the heavy lifting of language model inference to a dedicated service, freeing up our own resources for other tasks. All requests to the NeMo service are made via an HTTP API, which allows us to easily integrate it into our existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of interacting with the NeMo service, the NeMo team provides a Python client library (`nemollm`) that wraps the HTTP API. This library provides a simple interface for making requests to the NeMo service, and handles the details of making HTTP requests and parsing the responses. This allows us to focus on the high-level logic of our application, rather than the low-level details of making HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Experiment using a few golden examples to determine feasibility, and evaluate candidate models and prompts by hand\n",
    "2. Collect feedback on initial model outputs from experts and use this feedback to create a larger dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. In [Section 1.3](#1.3---Prompt-Templating), we added additional CVE details into the prompt by hand. While this strategy can be effective for adding additional context for very specific items like CVE Details, it requires a priori knowledge of what details to include (like those from NVD). When you would like to help your LLM with its query by adding more context in real-time, you're ready for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a query or checklist item is posed to an LLM equipped with RAG, the model first consults the vector database to find relevant information related to the query. This retrieved data is then combined with the original question and fed back into the LLM. With this enriched context, the LLM can generate a more accurate and informed response, potentially including evidence or reasoning based on the newly incorporated data. This approach not only improves the quality of the LLM's outputs and for our tool gives it access to project and container specific information to determine CVE exploitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - Building the Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having a query and LLM, RAG requires additional information to be stored in a vector database. One mechanism of finding the proper information from the database is to first embed the query into the same vector space and retrieve the top most similar items via a distance metric. The additional information is then presented in the prompt of the LLM. The neighboring vectors in the database are said to be \"semantically similar\" to the query and likely relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our demonstration purposes, we would like our LLM to be able to access the code repository of the project we're interested in checking for exploitable CVEs. The first step is transforming the specific repo into a vector database.\n"

    "### 3.2 - Scaling the Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "When running pipelines which utilize LLMs, it's important to understand how the LLMs are executed to parallelize their execution as much as possible. This is because LLMs can take a long time to run, as low as a few hundred milliseconds and upwards of a few seconds. Running LLMs serially can compound those runtimes leading to execution times that grow linearly with the number of LLM requests. A simple diagram of the execution of LLMs for our CVE pipeline is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single CVE - Serial](./images/single_cve_serial.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, we can see that the LLMs are executed serially, one after the other. This is not ideal as the execution time of the pipeline is directly proportional to the number of LLMs that are executed. However, there is no dependency between the LLM calls in each of checklist items. This means that we can parallelize the execution of the LLMs to reduce the overall execution time of the pipeline. A simple diagram of the parallel execution of LLMs for our CVE pipeline is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single CVE - Parallel](./images/single_cve_parallel.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, we can see that the total execution time has been reduced as the checklist agent LLMs are executed in parallel. The total execution time is now the maximum time taken to execute any of the LLM agent chains. This is a significant improvement over the serial execution of the LLMs. But what happens if we need to run the entire pipeline for multiple CVEs? A naive approach would be to run the pipeline for each CVE serially, which is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multiple CVE - Serial](./images/multiple_cve_serial.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "With most LLM libraries, this is the default behavior and improving on this requires more complex solutions such as multiprocessing or distributed workers. However, with Morpheus, this is trivial since Morpheus benefits from pipeline parallelism where each message is processed in an assembly line fashion. This means that we can start processing the next message before the previous one is even completed. A simple diagram of the parallel execution of the pipeline for multiple CVEs is shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "In a true production environment, the CVE scans would be triggered by some other event, such as a new container being uploaded into a registry or a new project being created. In this section, we will show how to create a microservice that can be triggered by an event and run the pipeline we built in the previous sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, when our pipeline was started, it would read all inputs from a DataFrame and run the pipeline for each input. Once the pipeline was done processing the DataFrame, it would shutdown. To run the pipeline as a microservice, we need to modify the pipeline to run continuously and listen for new inputs on an HTTP endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in Morpheus this is as easy as changing out the type of source that is used in the pipeline. The code below is identical to the previous pipeline except we have changed the source from `InMemorySourceStage` to `HttpServerSourceStage`. The `HttpServerSourceStage` class listens for new inputs on an HTTP endpoint and passes them to the next stage in the pipeline. It pulls the inputs from the request body and passes them to the pipeline to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, right after the `HttpServerSourceStage` we have added a simple custom stage to the pipeline `print_payload`. This custom stage simply prints the payload that was passed to the pipeline. This is useful for debugging and logging exactly when the pipeline was triggered since the results may take time to process and be shown to the console.\n"
