## Build libmorpheus Documentation

### Install Doxygen

Install Doxygen using mamba.

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge doxygen
```

### Build libmorpheus HTML Documentation
There are multiple ways to build the libmorpheus HTML documentation.

* Run the `doxygen` command from the `morpheus/_lib/doxygen` directory containing the `Doxyfile`.
```bash
cd morpheus/_lib/doxygen
doxygen
```

* The libmorpheus documentation can also be built using `cmake` from the Morpheus root directory.
```bash
./scripts/compile.sh # This will generate the build directory
cmake --build build -j --target docs_morpheus
```

Note: Doxygen reads and processes all appropriate source files under the `morpheus/_lib/include/` directory and generates the output in the `morpheus/_lib/doxygen/html` directory. You can load the local `morpheus/_lib/doxygen/html/index.html` file generated there into any web browser to view the result.
