/**
 * @brief Creates and manages the lifetime of a GPUNetIO Receive Pipe for a given GPUNetIO Receive Queue.
 *
 * Pipes are used to filter and/or forward packets to other Pipes or Receive Queues. A Root Pipe
 * is the primary Pipe where packets come in, and can then be forwarded to other Pipes. This is how
 * TCP/UDP as well as other types of filtering is done with GPUNetIO. Eventually packets will be
 * placed in a Receive Queue at which point they can be read using a Semaphore.
 *
 * In this implementation, a single Root Pipe is connected to a single TCP-filtering Pipe which is
 * then connected to the given Receive Queue.
